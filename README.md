# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

In this project I will be using what I have learned in the AiCore course so far, including my knowledge of Python, OOP and best practices. As the project grows I will add more information to this document, such as: Table of Contents, Installation instructions, Usage instructions, File Structure and License information.

## Installation
To play Hangman, clone this repository to a directory of your choosing. This repository has a dependency on the random module, this is a in-built Python module.
Follow the [Usage](#usage) section to see how the Hangman project is used.

## Usage
Once you have this repository on your local machine you now have the ability to play Hangman!

You have two options to play the Hangman game:
1. Play the Hangman game with the default set of words.
2. Play the Hangman game with your own list of words, or a generated word list from a dataset.

### Playing the game with the default set of words.
Within the repository there is the ``` milestone_5.py ``` file. This file defines the Hangman class and it's methods, you can run ``` python -c 'import milestone_5; help(milestone_5)' ``` in the terminal to see the Class documentation.

Or alternatively, you can create a script within the same directory and import the module to this script, like so:
