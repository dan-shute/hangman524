# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

In this project I will be using what I have learned in the AiCore course so far, including my knowledge of Python, OOP and best practices. As the project grows I will add more information to this document, such as: Table of Contents, Installation instructions, Usage instructions, File Structure and License information.

# Usage
When using this project you can play Hangman against the computer. The computer will generate a random word and you will be asked to input a guess.
